 ## Natural Disasters Intensity Analysis And Classification Using Artificial Intelligence
 ## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
   Natural disasters not only disturb the human ecological system but also destroy the properties and critical infrastructures of human societies and even lead to permanent change in the ecosystem. Disaster can be caused by naturally occurring events such as earthquakes, cyclones, floods, and wildfires. Many deep learning techniques have been applied by various researchers to detect and classify natural disasters to overcome losses in ecosystems, but detection of natural disasters still faces issues due to the complex and imbalanced structures of images. To tackle this problem, we developed a multilayered deep convolutional neural network model that classifies the natural disaster and tells the intensity of disaster  of natural The model uses an integrated webcam to capture the video frame and the video frame is compared with the Pre-trained model and the type of disaster is identified and showcased on the OpenCV window. 

### Can AI detect natural disasters?
   Artificial intelligence (AI), in particular machine learning (ML), is playing an increasingly important role in disaster risk reduction (DRR) â€“ from the forecasting of extreme events and the development of hazard maps to the detection of events in real time, the provision of situational awareness and decision support, and beyond.

             Application of AI to the detection and forecasting of natural hazards and disasters derived from a preliminary literature survey covering articles published between 2018 and 2021 with a focus on (future) DRR applications. These results show an overrepresentation of certain natural hazard types, particularly floods, earthquakes, and landslides.
